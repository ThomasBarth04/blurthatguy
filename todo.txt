MVP:
1. take video input
2. split into frames
3. use https://aiven.io/developer/find-faces-with-pgvector?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=MatthewBerman&utm_campaign=imp to find faces and save them. (dont track a face, but recogice)
4. then find a way to create box around a selected face saved from step 3 througut the entire video.
5. blur that box.
6. get chat to create frontend

Maybe:
1. rewrite from python to c++ and compile to WASM, then we can host on vercel and use node workers to run the bluring. 
2. blur from livefeed
